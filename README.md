## Conclusion

Arduino is ideal for simple embedded projects and tasks that require real-time control.​
Raspberry Pi is suitable for more complex projects, running applications, and tasks that require a full operating system.​

The choice between them depends on the project requirements, complexity, and the desired level of functionality.​

### Outcomes:​

Understanding basic circuit components (LED, resistor).​

Hands-on experience with hardware connections.(Using Simulator)​

Grasping/Rebrushing fundamental programming concepts.
